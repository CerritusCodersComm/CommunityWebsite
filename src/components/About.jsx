          We are a student-run community focusing on open source, project-based learning. <br />
          This community is run solely by students, for students, to encourage development, open-source, and help the
          community unlock their full potential, one step at a time. Contributing to open-source and focusing on
          project-based learning are two of many interests that my community share. Our community was created on the
          18th of December last year and we started it to help a bunch of classmates to get started with open source and
          project based learning. Since then we have just grown, and I am happy to share that the community has helped
          over 100+ students. Now we are 130-140 folks strong!
